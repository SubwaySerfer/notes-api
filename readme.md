# Notes API

## Overview
The Notes API is a lightweight backend application written in Go. It allows users to manage text-based notes through a RESTful interface. The application supports basic CRUD operations and is designed to be simple and easy to use, with minimal dependencies.

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete text notes.
- Persistent storage using SQLite or in-memory storage for quick prototyping.
- JSON-based communication for easy integration with other systems.
- Lightweight and fast, with no unnecessary overhead.

## API Endpoints
1. **GET /notes**
   - Retrieve all notes.

2. **GET /notes/{id}**
   - Retrieve a specific note by its ID.

3. **POST /notes**
   - Create a new note.

4. **PUT /notes/{id}**
   - Update an existing note.

5. **DELETE /notes/{id}**
   - Delete a note by its ID.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (v1.20 or later)
- Optional: SQLite for persistent storage

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
4. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Testing the API
Use tools like Postman, curl, or any HTTP client to interact with the API. Example:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/notes
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add user authentication for secure access.
- Implement advanced filtering and searching for notes.
- Support for tagging and categorization.
